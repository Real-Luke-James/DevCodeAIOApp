This Branch was made to hold the UWP App and, so I don't waste my time, made a zip holding all of the source files. In order to find the zip, go to releases and download the UWPSource.zip file.
Also, in order to download the UWP App setup, Download the UWPAppFiles.zip file and run the .msixbundle file.
